This blog is the work of a very nerdy individual with too much time on their hands.
<p>
This is me doing my best to convey what I know about my time spent with computers. Working with them, repairing them, getting frustrated at them. Let this be a compendium of my successes and my failures. It is impossible for us to understand where we are going, if we don't know where we began.
<p>
And I hope that by viewing my journey, you may better understand your own. Whatever profession/destiny you have set out for yourself. Never give up on that. Use your goals to better understand the world around you,and how you relate to it.

## What is jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.
<br />Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost. -->
