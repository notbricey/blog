Recent CIS graduate with an emphasis in cybersecurity. Go by the alias bri5ee (brr-eye-see). Currently, I do Detection Engineering and IR for a living, am an active Red Team member for the Western Regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition ("WRCCDC"), coaching Cal Poly Pomona's cybersecurity club SWIFT's competition teams such as their Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition ("CPTC") team, and am always looking to learn more about cyber in my free time. Essentially I am passionate about penetration testing, red teaming, detection engineering and IR, cybersecurity competitions, and anything security related.

### About The Blog

This blog will consist of anything related to penetration testing, red teaming, blue teaming, other security related topics, and random things I find interesting. The goal of this blog is to be able to teach others about cybersecurity by not simply being a quick guide/walkthrough of CTFs, general topics, etc. but to go into depth and ensure clarity with technical concepts that arise. By having this approach to the blog, I hope that readers will be able to gain a thorough amount of information that will benefit them on their future endeavors in cybersecurity.


<!-- # jekyll-theme-console
<!-- 
A jekyll theme with inspiration from linux consoles for hackers, developers and script kiddies.
You can find the source code for this theme at [github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console).

## What is jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under an open source license.
<br />Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost. -->
