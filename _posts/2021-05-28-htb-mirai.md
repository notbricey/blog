## Initial Thoughts Based On Nmap Scan

Looking at the ports we have `22 SSH`, `53 DNS`, and `80 HTTP`. Looking at SSH, this is a port that I typically look back on but do not jump straight into. The reason for this is usually we need valid credentials or at the least a username so we could attempt to brutefoce a user. Next, DNS is a good port to look into to gain more information about the host. We could perform `zone transfers` which can reveal a lot of information about a domain. For port 80 HTTP, doing manual enumeration and spidering the website by hand with Burp Suite on while automated scans are running such as `gobuster`, `nikto`, etc. to ensure we are using are time wisely would be an important first step. Testing any parameters and anywhere user input can be thrown into is also another good thing to attempt and using characters that may break a web application such as a single quote, double quote, pipe, etc. Also attempting to find any version numbers, checking for default credentials, etc. is something I will be looking out for. I'm going to quickly look at DNS and HTTP and see what is of the most importance and triage from there.

## 53 - DNS | Enumeration

When looking into DNS, especially if DNS is on TCP, this usually indicates that it is trying to facilitate some sort of DNS zone transfer. So we can try this command:

```
dig axfr @10.10.10.48 pi.hole
```

We don't get anything with zone transfers so I assume there isn't much with DNS most likely.

## 80 - HTTP | Enumeration

Navigating to `10.10.10.48` I am presented with just a blank page. Trying to view the page source shows nothing. I decided to go and run a `gobuster` to potentially find other directories.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/mirai/image-20210609143750108.png" />
</p>

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.48 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .txt,.html,.php
```

When running my scan the first thing that popped up was an `admin` directory.  Navigating to `10.10.10.48/admin` brought me to a page where it seems to be running `Pi-Hole`. In simple terms, Pi-Hole helps with network-wide ad blocking by having its DNS be a sinkhole that will stop unwanted content such as ads. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/mirai/image-20210609144358000.png" />
</p>

Before I start looking into Pi-Hole and manually navigating around, I started another `gobuster`, but I have it searching through the `/admin` directory now. 

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.48/admin -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .txt,.html,.php
```


The first place I decided to look into was the `Login` page. I started trying basic passwords like `password, password123,` etc. No luck with those. I also looked into what the default credentials for Pi-Hole was which is `pi:raspberry`. No luck there either. I waited for my gobuster scans to finish, but none of these directories or files were of any use. I take a step back for a bit and remember that I could try using these credentials somewhere else, this being `SSH`. 

## Access to the Host via SSH and Default Credentials

```
┌──(root@kali)-[~]
└─# ssh pi@10.10.10.48    
pi@10.10.10.48's password:

pi@raspberrypi:~ $ 
```

And we successfully logged in. As always, before I run any enumeration tools I like to just do a quick `sudo -l` to see if I am able to execute certain things with sudo permissions.

## Privilege Escalation

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for pi on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User pi may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

And it tells me that I can just run whatever I want with `sudo` with no password. I'm just going to type `sudo su` and get root.

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo su
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# id && whoami
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root
```

Usually I would just stop here since I got root, but the `root.txt` isn't actually just laying in plain sight. 

```
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# cat /root/root.txt
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```

## Finding the `root.txt` flag.

Within the `root.txt` file we see something about how apparently this user lost the original `root.txt` file and is on their `USB stick`. Since it is talking about a USB stick, I'm going to just use the `mount` command to see what devices are mounted on the host.

```

```

Under `/dev/sdb` we can see there was a `usbstick` mentioned. We can just use `strings` against `/dev/sdb` which will literally read the bits off of the device.

```
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# strings /dev/sdb
>r &
/media/usbstick
lost+found
root.txt
damnit.txt

Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?
-James
```

And we see `3d3e483143ff12ec505d026fa13e020b` which is the root flag! 

Overall this box was pretty straight forward. Boxes that force me to think back and use credentials everywhere is a great thing to get used to as this may definitely be a way in when doing the OSCP exam. I also enjoyed that it wasn't as simple as running `sudo su` and grabbing the `root.txt` flag.
